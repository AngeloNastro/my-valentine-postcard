# Would You Be My Valentine?

A cute, interactive Valentine’s Day card for GitHub Pages. The page asks "Would you be my Valentine?" with two buttons: "Yes" and "No". The "No" button moves away when hovered, making it impossible to click.

## How it works

- **Yes**: Shows a sweet message.
- **No**: Button moves away when you try to click it!

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Deploy to GitHub Pages (main branch, root folder).
3. Open your GitHub Pages URL to see the card.

## Files

- `index.html` – Main page
- `style.css` – Cute styling
- `script.js` – Button movement logic

Happy Valentine’s Day! 💖
